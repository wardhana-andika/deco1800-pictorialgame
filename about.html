	<h2>About Us</h2>
	
	<div class="speech">
		<p id="aboutus">We are a group of undergraduate students undertaking a course called "Design Computing Studio: Interactive Technology" at the University of Queensland. Our main objective for the semester was to conceptualize, refine and implement a web-based application that integrates content retrieved from the National Library of Australia`s Trove portal into a fun, interactive game. As a result, Geo Guesser was developed. Geo Guesser is a fun, educational guessing game that strives to inform the public about fascinating landmarks from all over the world! We hope you have as much fun playing our game as we did developing it!</p>
